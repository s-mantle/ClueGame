    Refactor I: Thorough documentation of drawBoard()

One of the more significant changes we implemented was refactoring our DoorDirection if-else chain into a separate method with multiple implementations. We use this chunk of code 3 times throughout the Board class with relatively minor differences inside the if statement contents. In order to abstract this complexity out, we built a helper method doorHandler which takes in parameters for the variables to update and returns those variable values. The specific variables are different depending on what the DoorDirection identifier is implementing specifically, so we have provided one example below of the initial code and the refactored method. This if-else chain was further refined to eliminate the need for creating a new BoardCell variable by simply calling our draw() methods on the grid itself.

Before:
if (doorDir == DoorDirection.UP) {
	BoardCell queriedCell = grid[i-1][j];
	queriedCell.drawDoor(BorderLayout.SOUTH, cellWidths, doorThickness);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.DOWN) {
	BoardCell queriedCell = grid[i+1][j];
	queriedCell.drawDoor(BorderLayout.NORTH, cellWidths, doorThickness);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.LEFT) {
	BoardCell queriedCell = grid[i][j-1];
	queriedCell.drawDoor(BorderLayout.EAST, doorThickness, cellHeights);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.RIGHT) {
	BoardCell queriedCell = grid[i][j+1];
	queriedCell.drawDoor(BorderLayout.WEST, doorThickness, cellHeights);
}

After:
if (doorDir == DoorDirection.UP) {
	grid[i-1][j].drawDoor(BorderLayout.SOUTH, cellWidths, doorThickness);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.DOWN) {
	grid[i+1][j].drawDoor(BorderLayout.NORTH, cellWidths, doorThickness);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.LEFT) {
	grid[i][j-1].drawDoor(BorderLayout.EAST, doorThickness, cellHeights);
} else if (doorDir == DoorDirection.RIGHT) {
	grid[i][j+1].drawDoor(BorderLayout.WEST, doorThickness, cellHeights);
}
