We adopted the style of test cases from FileInitTests306, but varied our cells based on which
cells were most important to our board for testing room statuses, doorways, labels, centers, 
etc. 

testLayoutAndSetupLoaded():
	Specifically, we tested every room we are creating instead of the sample rooms, and then
	choose to test the walkway and unplayable squares more due to the general lack of testing
	them in the provided example.
	
testRowsAndColumnsCount():
	We tested the same as the example, you can't really change these values.
	
testDoorwaysEachDirection():
	We selected a variety of doorways, trying to cover a majority of our board's span such that
	if the file is inaccurately read in, then that spread of doorways would fail the test.
	
testCorrectNumberOfDoors():
	We basically mirrored the given file - there isn't a whole lot of room for variability here.
	
testRandomCellValues():
	We aimed to cover cells which we had tested the least before. This meant centers & labels
	primarily, but also just generic cells. As the vast majority of our cells will just be
	empty room cells or empty walkway cells, we wanted to ensure that those cells are still
	functioning properly. However, we still made sure to check a good breadth of cells to ensure
	that the scope of our testing would not be too limited to let sneaky errors get by.
